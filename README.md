Project_Euler
=============

In this repository, you can find my solutions to some of the problems in Project Euler. Many of them are not optimized, the purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and to see my gradual improvement in terms of functional programming.
These solutions (1-30) were written in March 2013-April 2013
